INTRODUCTION

Developped by: edelbalso <http://github.com/edelbalso>

This module adds theming capabilities above and beyond the default cakephp
included theming capabilities. It essentially is centered not on production-
quality high scalability webpages, but instead is focused on rapid prototyping
and quick releasing mostly motivated by my low-traffic client work.

The file structure and inclusion scheme is based on an article I wrote here : 

http://bakery.cakephp.org/articles/view/maintaining-an-application-independant-code-library


INSTALLATION
------------

1. Copy the files to its own folder on your computer. I prefer something like :

   /Users/me/lib/cakephp/themeslib/

2. Assuming the above directory, add the following line to your bootstrap.php :

   require(DS.'Users'.DS.'edu'.DS.'lib'.DS.'cakephp'.DS.'themeslib'.DS.'lib.inc');

4. In your AppController, add 'Interface' to your helpers vars.

5. In your config/core.php, add :

   Configure::write('themeslib.theme','fluid960_fixed_12');

   where fluid960_fixed_12 can be any theme name that exists.


INSTRUCTIONS
------------

As I move forward this section will be more rigid. Basically the idea here is
that all my web applications can be broken down into discrete elements: Forms,
blockquotes, thumbnails, full images, etc etc.

As a basis, I will be using all the interface elements defined in the Fluid960 
distribution available here: http://www.designinfluences.com/fluid960gs/

That is:
 * Paragraph
 * Menu
 * Unordered List
 * Ordered List
 * Link
 * Table
 * Login Form
 * Regular Form
 * etc, etc.

So the idea is that for each element, we can abstract the html into PHP function
calls that output the desired markup. So opening a table would be:

$interface->table() instead of <table>, and closed with $interface->ctable() 
instead of </table>

This will allow us to change markup application-wide instantaneously, as well as
over-ride markup for common application-wide elements in the case where we're 
using some sort of downloaded template who's CSS requires specific markup.
